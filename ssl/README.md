# SSL Certificates Directory

This directory contains SSL certificates for HTTPS support.

## Files (automatically generated)

- `cert.pem` - SSL certificate (public key)
- `key.pem` - SSL private key (keep secure!)

## DO NOT commit these files to git!

Both files are in .gitignore for security.

## Regenerate certificates

Run: `./scripts/setup-ssl-localhost.sh`
